\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame containing study-level summary statistics for continuous outcomes.}

\item{measure}{Character. Effect size measure, e.g., "SMD" (standardized mean difference) or "MD" (mean difference). Default is "SMD".}

\item{method}{Character. Method for meta-analysis, e.g., "REML" or "FE". Default is "REML".}

\item{xlab}{Character. Label for the x-axis. Default is "".}

\item{title}{Character. Title of the forest plot. Default is NULL.}

\item{model}{Character. Meta-analysis model: "Random-effects" or "Fixed-effects". Default is "Random-effects".}

\item{estimator}{Character. Estimator for the random-effects model. Default is "REML".}

\item{m_c_col}{Character. Column name for control group mean in \code{dat}.}

\item{sd_c_col}{Character. Column name for control group standard deviation in \code{dat}.}

\item{n_c_col}{Character. Column name for control group sample size in \code{dat}.}

\item{m_t_col}{Character. Column name for treatment group mean in \code{dat}.}

\item{sd_t_col}{Character. Column name for treatment group standard deviation in \code{dat}.}

\item{n_t_col}{Character. Column name for treatment group sample size in \code{dat}.}

\item{CI.col}{Character. Color of the confidence intervals. Default is "blue".}

\item{Pred.Inter.col}{Character. Color of the prediction interval. Default is "black".}

\item{square.size}{Numeric. Size of the study squares in the forest plot. Default is 10.}

\item{contour_fill}{Character vector. Colors used for contour shading of effect sizes. Default is c("gray95","gray80","gray60","gray40").}
